    # TODO: Remove this remove operation when switching to the seed image. The minimal image is currently
    # being used and it has dracut-hostonly installed, so it needs to be removed before testing, since it
    # prevents the image from booting in a VM and being tested. Removing the package will cause a rebuild of
    # the initramfs to include drivers necessary to find the root filesystem on the disk. While using the
    # minimal image, without removing this package, dracut will hang during the boot process waiting for the
    # root filesystem to be found.
