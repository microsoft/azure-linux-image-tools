After running the command, the Image Creator binary will be located at

## Run Image Creator specific tests

1. Download the test RPM files and the tools tar file to create new image:

   ```bash
   ./toolkit/tools/internal/testutils/testrpms/download-test-utils.sh -t 3.0 -s true
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   sudo go test -C ./toolkit/tools ./pkg/imagecreatorlib -args \
     --run-create-image-tests true
   ```

3. To update go dependencies (direct and indirect) to minor or patch versions,
   run `go get -u ./...` then `go mod tidy`.
