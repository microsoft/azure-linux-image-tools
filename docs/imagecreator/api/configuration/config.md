## os [[os](../../../imagecustomizer/api/configuration/os.md)]

## scripts [[scripts](../../../imagecustomizer/api/configuration/scripts.md)]

## previewFeatures [string[]]

Enables preview features.

Preview features are features that have not yet been stabilized.
Their APIs and behavior are subject to change.

Supported options:

- `package-snapshot-time`: Enables snapshot-based package filtering during image customization. See
  the detailed definition in the section below.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  os:
  previewFeatures:
  - package-snapshot-time
  ```

- `package-snapshot-time`: Enables snapshot-based package filtering during image
  customization. This allows specifying a cutoff timestamp using the
  [`--package-snapshot-time`](../../../imagecustomizer/api/cli.md#--package-snapshot-time) CLI option or
  [`os.packages.snapshotTime`](../../../imagecustomizer/api/configuration/packages.md#snapshottime-string) API field.
  If both are provided, the CLI value takes precedence.
