# Image History

The Image History feature records the customization history of images in a
structured JSON format. It enables users to:

- Trace the lineage of customized images.
- Verify input integrity using SHA256 hashes.
- Debug and identify issues in customization workflows.

Image history tracking can be disabled by explicitly configuring the option in
the [OS configuration settings](../api/configuration/os.md)

## History Storage

- **Location:** `/usr/share/image-customizer/history.json`.
- **Format:** An array of JSON objects, each representing a customization step.
- **Order:** Each new history entry is appended to the end of the existing list
  within the history file, preserving chronological sequence across image
  customizations.

## Metadata Captured

Each entry in the history includes:

- **Timestamp:** Time of customization.
- **Tool Version:** Image customizer version used.
- **Image UUID:** Unique identifier for the image.
- **Configuration:** Captures the config used for customization (with certain
  modifications).

## Config Modifications

The configuration undergoes specific modifications before being serialized into
JSON format:

**Hashing:**

- SHA256 hashes are generated for scripts, additional files, and the contents of
  additional directories to ensure input integrity.
- If only content is provided for scripts or additional files (and no source
  path), no hash is calculated or added. When a source path is specified, a
  SHA256 hash is computed and included as a field in the JSON configuration.
- For additional directories, a hashmap of each file to its SHA256 hash is added
  as a field in the JSON configuration.

**Redaction:** Known sensitive information, such as SSH public keys, is replaced
with `[redacted]` to maintain security.
