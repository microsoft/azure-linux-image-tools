# System extension

System extensions (sysext) are a systemd feature that allows extending an operating
system without modifying the base system. They are useful for immutable or read-only
OS environments, enabling modular functionality while preserving system integrity.

Key Characteristics:
- Dynamic Overlay: Files from a sysext image are dynamically overlaid onto /usr and /opt
  at runtime.
- Immutable Base System: The base OS remains unchanged, allowing independent updates.
- Modular & Flexible: Extensions can be added, removed, or updated without modifying
  core OS files.
- Verification & Security: Sysext images can include dm-verity and cryptographic
  signatures to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- No Persistent Changes: Once deactivated, system extensions disappear from the
  filesystem without leaving traces.

## System Extension Image

System extension images are the packaged format used to deliver system extensions.
They contain the files to be overlaid onto the base system, typically under `/usr` and
`/opt`.

System extensions may be delivered in several formats:
- Plain directories or btrfs subvolumes containing the OS tree
- Disk images with a GPT disk label, following the Discoverable Partitions Specification
- Raw disk images without a partition table, using a naked Linux file system such as
  erofs, squashfs, or ext4

This doc focuses on GPT-labeled disk images because they offer strong standardization,
compatibility with the Discoverable Partitions Specification, and support for integrity
features like `dm-verity`. This makes them ideal for production environments where
immutability, verifiability, and consistent system behavior are critical.

A properly formatted sysext image will typically contain:

| Partition Name                   | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Root Filesystem Partition        | Contains the extension's files (e.g., binaries, libraries, configurations). |
| Verity Hash Partition (optional) | Stores a Merkle tree hash of the root filesystem for dm-verity integrity.   |
| Signature Partition (optional)   | Holds a digital signature verifying the integrity of the hash data.         |

## Building Sysext Images with mkosi

mkosi is the recommended tool for building system extension images. It automates the
creation of properly formatted GPT images, including:
- Partitioning the image (root filesystem, verity, signature).
- Applying integrity verification using dm-verity.
- Signing the image (if needed).

For detailed documentation on mkosi commands and configuration, refer to 
[mkosi documentation](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/blob/main/mkosi/resources/man/mkosi.1.md)

### 1. Get mkosi

You can either use mkosi directly from source or install it via a package manager:

Option 1: Use from source (recommended if you need to modify partition configurations):

```
git clone https://github.com/systemd/mkosi
ln -s $PWD/mkosi/bin/mkosi ~/.local/bin/mkosi
mkosi --version
```

Option 2: Install via package manager

For detailed installation instructions, refer to [mkosi source repo](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi).

### 2. Generating Verity Keys and Certificates

Before building a signed sysext image, you'll need to generate a key pair.
Here are example commands for using OpenSSL to generate keys for private signing:

1. Generate a private key:

    `openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out verity_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096`

2. Create a self-signed certificate using the private key:

    `openssl req -new -x509 -key verity_key.pem -out verity_cert.crt -days 365`

For production use, you may want to use a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate
Authority instead of a self-signed certificate.

### 3. Define the Image Configuration

1. Create a `mkosi.conf`: defines the build parameters for your sysext image. This
   configuration file tells mkosi what to include in the image, how to format it, and how
   to handle verification.

2. Update `sysext.repart.d/` if needed: this directory contains partition definition
   files (.conf files) that instruct systemd-repart how to create and structure the
   partitions within the sysext image, including:
    - Content partition (holds the actual files)
    - Verity hash partition (used for integrity verification)
    - Signature partition (optional, contains cryptographic signature)

  (Note: Typically, users can create customized sysext.repart.d/ files for certain aspects of
  the image structure. However, when using Format=sysext - unlike Format=disk, you
  cannot completely replace these definitions with your own custom repart
  configurations. For format=sysext, mkosi is specifically using its own predefined
  repart definitions located at [mkosi/resources/repart/definitions/sysext.repart.d]
  (https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/tree/main/mkosi/resources/repart/definitions/sysext.repart.d)
  If you need to modify the partition structure (e.g., to change filesystem types or
  partition sizes), you'll need to edit the .conf files in the mkosi installation
  directory, which will be in the system paths if installed via package manager or in
  the cloned repository.)

Example mkosi.conf

```ini
[Output]
Format=sysext
ImageId=custom-tools
ImageVersion=1.0.0
OutputDirectory=mkosi.output

[Validation]
Verity=signed
VerityKey=verity_key.pem
VerityCertificate=verity_cert.crt

[Content]
ExtraTrees=/path/to/custom-tool:/usr/bin/custom-tool,/path/to/tool-config:/usr/lib/custom-tool/config
```

#### [Output] Section
- Format=sysext: Specifies that we are building a system extension image.
- ImageId=custom-tools: Defines the image identifier, which is used in the output filename.
- ImageVersion=1.0.0: (Optional)Sets the version number of the image, included in metadata and
  the default filename.
- OutputDirectory=mkosi.output: (Optional)Specifies the directory where the output file will be
  stored. If not specified, the current working directory will be used.

#### [Validation] Section
The Verity= setting determines how your sysext image is secured:
- signed: Fully signed image with both hash data and a cryptographic signature (requires
  VerityKey & VerityCertificate). Only X.509 certificates are supported for signing dm-verity
  partitions in systemd-sysext.
- defer: Allocates space for a signature but does not populate it yet (useful for
  external signing).
- hash: Hash verification only (no signature).
- false: No verity at all (unsigned, unverified image).
- VerityKey=verity_key.pem: The private key used for signing.
- VerityCertificate=verity_cert.crt: The public certificate used for verification.

#### [Content] Section
While there are multiple ways to include content in a sysext image, we will focus on the
direct file copying method with `ExtraTrees=`. This approach is the most straightforward for
extending the system with custom tools, utilities, or specialized binaries that need to be
available at runtime without modifying the base OS.

`ExtraTrees=` specifies which binaries or files to include in the `sysext` image.
Format:
`source_path:destination_path` (comma-separated for multiple entries)

### 4. Build and validate the Image
```
mkosi --force
```

When a sysext image is built with the configurations above, it contains three partitions:

| Device             | Start Sector | End Sector | Size  | Type                          |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| custom-tools.raw1  | 2048         | 79983      | 38.1M | Linux root (x86-64)           |
| custom-tools.raw2  | 79984        | 100463     | 10M   | Linux root verity (x86-64)    |
| custom-tools.raw3  | 100464       | 100495     | 16K   | Linux root verity sign. (x86-64) |

- custom-tools.raw1: main filesystem partition (contains the custom tool and configuration)
- custom-tools.raw2: contains the Merkle tree hash data used to verify the integrity of
  the main filesystem partition
- custom-tools.raw3: contains the verity signature

## Integrate Sysext image into base image through Prism

These system extension procedures work seamlessly on Azure Linux 3.0, which include the
required systemd tooling. For older versions like Azure Linux 2.0, additional patches or
configuration may be needed to ensure compatibility with the mkosi build environment.

As part of its image customization process, Prism can include the .raw image into
/var/lib/extensions/. The public certificate verity_cert.crt can be placed under
/etc/verity.d/ if you'd like for persistent certificate storage across reboots, or be
copied to /run/verity.d/ at runtime for temporary certificate storage that will be cleared
after system restart.

To have your sysext extensions automatically applied at boot time, ensure
systemd-sysext.service is active so that `systemd-sysext merge` is triggered automatically
at boot.

Example Prism config
```yaml
# config.yaml
os:
  additionalFiles:
  - source: custom-tools.raw
    destination: /var/lib/extensions/custom-tools.raw
  - source: verity_cert.crt
    destination: /etc/verity.d/verity_cert.crt

  services:
    enable:
    - systemd-sysext
```

Systemd Verification Process at Runtime:

- `systemd-sysext merge` is triggered automatically at boot.
- systemd checks for a signature partition in the sysext image:
    - It extracts the embedded public key.
    - It compares it with the trusted certs in the base image.
    - If the certificate matches, systemd verifies the hash using dm-verity.
- Sysext is merged into /usr and /opt.

To check whether a system extension has been successfully loaded:

```
systemd-sysext status
```
As we specified the custom tool to be under /usr, only /usr was overlaid from the sysext image.
We will see:

| HIERARCHY | EXTENSIONS   | SINCE                      |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| /opt      | none         | -                          |
| /usr      | custom-tools | Tue 2025-04-01 16:51:25 UTC |

## What if Prism and sysext create overlay on the same mount point?

Prism has an API for overlay creation, so there could be a case where Prism and sysext create overlay on
the same mount point. They interact in a specific way that affects system behavior:

- Mounting Sequence:

  Prism's overlay mounts first during the boot process
  When systemd-sysext later attempts to create its overlay on the same mount point
  systemd-sysext detects the existing overlay and automatically adds the `redirect_dir=on`
  option

- How `redirect_dir=on` Changes Behavior:

  Standard overlays perform a complete merge of all layers, presenting files from all
  sources as if they were in a single directory
  With `redirect_dir=on`, systemd-sysext doesn't fully merge with Prism's overlay
  Instead, it redirects directory lookups to specific layers based on the access path
  This creates a partial separation between the two overlay systems

- Impact:

  Prism's overlay continues to merge its upper and lower directories normally
  systemd-sysext's overlay creates its own partially separate view
  Files from systemd-sysext aren't completely integrated into the unified view
  This separation is why PATH lookups may not find binaries provided by systemd-sysext

- Working with This Behavior:

  You can access these binaries using their full paths (e.g., /usr/local/bin/custom-tool
  instead of just custom-tool)
  Alternatively, create symbolic links from a PATH-accessible directory to the actual
  binary locations

- Best Practice:

  To ensure predictable behavior, avoid overlapping Prism and systemd-sysext overlays
  Reserve /usr and /opt exclusively for systemd-sysext.
