# inject-files subcommand

This is a preview feature.
Its API and behavior is subject to change.
You must enable this feature by specifying `inject-files` in the
[previewFeatures](../configuration/injectFilesConfig.md#previewfeatures-string) API.

This subcommand takes a base image and a config file (typically auto-generated
from the [output.artifacts](../configuration/outputArtifacts.md) API) and injects
files (like signed bootchain artifacts) back into the image at specified locations.

The output image will be written to the same path as the input image, unless
`--output-image-file` and `--output-image-format` are specified.

See [`injectFilesConfig`](../configuration/injectFilesConfig.md) for config format.

Added in v0.14.

## --config-file=FILE-PATH

Required.

The path to the file injection configuration, typically auto-generated from
the `output.artifacts` section of the image customization config.
